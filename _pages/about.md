I am a Master's student in Computer Science at Georgia Tech. I'm interested in increasing the autonomy and generalization capability of AI systems in our effort to understand the factors that lead to intelligent behavior and implement systems that exhibit this behavior in coordination with humans.

My current research interests are primarily in reinforcement learning: **partial observability**, **generalization**, and **multi-agent** systems--especially toward studying emergent, collaborative behavior. I'm also interested in **open-ended learning** and **LLMs for code generation**.

In the past, I've worked as a software engineer mainly focused on cloud-based backends--data processing, machine learning pipelines, and microservices.
