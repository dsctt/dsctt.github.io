I'm interested in developing an understanding of the fundamental mechanisms leading to intelligent behavior in individuals and societies + building systems that benefit from this understanding.

My research interests have primarily been in reinforcement learning: **partial observability**, **generalization**, and **multi-agent** systems--especially toward studying emergent, collaborative behavior. I'm also interested in **open-endedness** and **LLMs for code generation**.

In the past, I've worked as a software engineer mainly focused on cloud-based backends--data engineering, machine learning pipelines, and microservices.\
