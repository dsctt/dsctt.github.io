I am a Master's student in Computer Science at Georgia Tech. My research interests are primarily in reinforcement learning--partial observability, generalization, and multi-agent systems (especially toward studying emergent, collaborative behavior). In the past, I've worked as a software engineer mainly focusing on cloud backends--data processing, machine learning pipelines, and microservices.
