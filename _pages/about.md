I am a Master's student in Computer Science at Georgia Tech. My research interests include partial observability in RL, generalization in RL, and multi-agent RL especially toward studying collective intelligence and emergent (collaborative) behavior. In the past, I've worked as a software engineer mainly focusing on cloud backends--data processing, machine learning pipelines, and microservices.
