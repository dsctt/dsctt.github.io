I am a Master's student in Computer Science at Georgia Tech. I'm interested in increasing the autonomy and generalization capability of AI agents in our effort to understand the factors that lead to intelligent behavior and implement systems that exhibit this behavior in coordination with humans. My research interests are primarily in reinforcement learning: partial observability, generalization, and multi-agent systems--especially toward studying emergent, collaborative behavior. In the past, I've worked as a software engineer mainly focused on cloud backends--data processing, machine learning pipelines, and microservices.
